# Avinashak-Crime-prediction
Avinashak is a crime prediction and detection algorithm which uses various models (SVMs,Random Forests,Linear Reg...and so on) to predict the location,time and type of the crime in future.Accuracy and reliabilty of this model is still in question but till now, it successfully have achieved 37% accuracy in terms of location of crime prediiction. Still the 'Crime time' accuracy remains a challenge.
This was made as a Mini Project for 3rd Sem.
